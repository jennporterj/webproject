<p>Many dogs enjoy different types of dog sports. As well as being good exercise, these sports often
    allow dogs to use their natural instincts, like chasing, sniffing, and tugging. For many sports,
    dogs need to be physically fit, but ultimately, the focus is just on you and your dog having fun!
</p>


<h2>Example of Sports</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Agility</li>
    <li>Barn Hunt</li>
    <li>Dock Diving</li>
    <li>FastCat</li>
    <li>Flyball</li>
</ul>

<p>
These sports involve some level of competition, but the priority is always the safety and happiness of your dog. If you are
interested in trying out a sport for your dog, you should consider what your dog naturally likes to do, how old your dog is, and 
what their level of fitness is. For example, if you have a senior dog who loves to sniff and gets excited about squirrels, barn 
hunt may be for them! If you have a younger, more physically fit dog who loves obedience training, then an agility course might 
be fun for them!
